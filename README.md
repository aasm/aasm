# AASM - Ruby state machines [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/aasm/aasm.png)](http://travis-ci.org/aasm/aasm) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/aasm/aasm.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/aasm/aasm) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/aasm/aasm/badge.png?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/r/aasm/aasm)

This package contains AASM, a library for adding finite state machines to Ruby classes.

AASM started as the *acts_as_state_machine* plugin but has evolved into a more generic library
that no longer targets only ActiveRecord models. It currently provides adapters for
[ActiveRecord](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Base.html) and
[Mongoid](http://mongoid.org/), but it can be used for any Ruby class, no matter what
parent class it has (if any).

## Usage

Adding a state machine is as simple as including the AASM module and start defining
**states** and **events** together with their **transitions**:

```ruby
class Job
  include AASM

  aasm do
    state :sleeping, :initial => true
    state :running
    state :cleaning

    event :run do
      transitions :from => :sleeping, :to => :running
    end

    event :clean do
      transitions :from => :running, :to => :cleaning
    end

    event :sleep do
      transitions :from => [:running, :cleaning], :to => :sleeping
    end
  end

end
```

This provides you with a couple of public methods for instances of the class `Job`:

```ruby
job = Job.new
job.sleeping? # => true
job.may_run?  # => true
job.run
job.running?  # => true
job.sleeping? # => false
job.may_run?  # => false
job.run       # => raises AASM::InvalidTransition
```

If you don't like exceptions and prefer a simple `true` or `false` as response, tell
AASM not to be *whiny*:

```ruby
class Job
  ...
  aasm :whiny_transitions => false do
    ...
  end
end

job.running?  # => true
job.may_run?  # => false
job.run       # => false
```

### Callbacks

You can define a number of callbacks for your transitions. These methods will be
called, when certain criteria are met, like entering a particular state:

```ruby
class Job
  include AASM

  aasm do
    state :sleeping, :initial => true, :before_enter => :do_something
    state :running

    event :run, :after => Proc.new { |user| notify_somebody(user) } do
      transitions :from => :sleeping, :to => :running, :on_transition => Proc.new {|obj, *args| obj.set_process(*args) }
    end

    event :sleep do
      after do
        ...
      end
      error do |e|
        ...
      end
      transitions :from => :running, :to => :sleeping
    end
  end

  def set_process(name)
    ...
  end

  def do_something
    ...
  end

  def notify_somebody(user)
    ...
  end

end
```

In this case `do_something` is called before actually entering the state `sleeping`,
while `notify_somebody` is called after the transition `run` (from `sleeping` to `running`)
is finished.

Here you can see a list of all possible callbacks, together with their order of calling:

```ruby
  event:before
    previous_state:before_exit
      new_state:before_enter
        ...update state...
      previous_state:after_exit
    new_state:after_enter
  event:after
```

Also, you can pass parameters to events:

```ruby
  job = Job.new
  job.run(:running, :defragmentation)
```

In this case the `set_process` would be called with `:defagmentation` argument.

In case of an error during the event processing the error is rescued and passed to `:error`
callback, which can handle it or re-raise it for further propagation.

### Guards

Let's assume you want to allow particular transitions only if a defined condition is
given. For this you can set up a guard per transition, which will run before actually
running the transition. If the guard returns `false` the transition will be
denied (raising `AASM::InvalidTransition` or returning `false` itself):

```ruby
class Job
  include AASM

  aasm do
    state :sleeping, :initial => true
    state :running
    state :cleaning

    event :run do
      transitions :from => :sleeping, :to => :running
    end

    event :clean do
      transitions :from => :running, :to => :cleaning
    end

    event :sleep do
      transitions :from => :running, :to => :sleeping, :guard => :cleaning_needed?
    end
  end

  def cleaning_needed?
    false
  end

end

job = Job.new
job.run
job.may_sleep?  # => false
job.sleep       # => raises AASM::InvalidTransition
```


### ActiveRecord

AASM comes with support for ActiveRecord and allows automatical persisting of the object's
state in the database.

```ruby
class Job < ActiveRecord::Base
  include AASM

  aasm do # default column: aasm_state
    state :sleeping, :initial => true
    state :running

    event :run do
      transitions :from => :sleeping, :to => :running
    end

    event :sleep do
      transitions :from => :running, :to => :sleeping
    end
  end

end
```

You can tell AASM to auto-save the object or leave it unsaved

```ruby
job = Job.new
job.run   # not saved
job.run!  # saved
```

Saving includes running all validations on the `Job` class. If you want make sure
the state gets saved without running validations (and thereby maybe persisting an
invalid object state), simply tell AASM to skip the validations:

```ruby
class Job < ActiveRecord::Base
  include AASM

  aasm :skip_validation_on_save => true do
    state :sleeping, :initial => true
    state :running

    event :run do
      transitions :from => :sleeping, :to => :running
    end

    event :sleep do
      transitions :from => :running, :to => :sleeping
    end
  end

end
```

### Automatic Scopes

AASM will automatically create scope methods for each state in the model.

```ruby
class Job < ActiveRecord::Base
  include AASM

  aasm do
    state :sleeping, :initial => true
    state :running
    state :cleaning
  end

  def sleeping
    "This method name is in already use"
  end
end
```

```ruby
class JobsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @running_jobs = jobs.running
    @recent_cleaning_jobs = jobs.cleaning.where('created_at >=  ?', 3.days.ago)

    # @sleeping_jobs = jobs.sleeping   #=> "This method name is in already use"
  end
end
```

### Transaction support

Since version *3.0.13* AASM supports ActiveRecord transactions. So whenever a transition
callback or the state update fails, all changes to any database record are rolled back.

### Column name & migration

As a default AASM uses the column `aasm_state` to store the states. You can override
this by defining your favorite column name, using `:column` like this:

```ruby
class Job < ActiveRecord::Base
  include AASM

  aasm :column => 'my_state' do
    ...
  end

end
```

Whatever column name is used, make sure to add a migration to provide this column
(of type `string`):

```ruby
class AddJobState < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def self.up
    add_column :jobs, :aasm_state, :string
  end

  def self.down
    remove_column :jobs, :aasm_state
  end
end
```

### <a id="inspection">Inspection

AASM supports a couple of methods to find out which states or events are provided or permissible.

Given the `Job` class from above:

```ruby
job = Job.new

job.aasm.states
=> [:sleeping, :running, :cleaning]

job.aasm.states(:permissible => true)
=> [:running]
job.run
job.aasm.states(:permissible => true)
=> [:cleaning, :sleeping]

job.aasm.events
=> [:run, :clean, :sleep]
```
